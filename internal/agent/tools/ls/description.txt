ls is a tool that lists the files and directories in a specified path.
By default, it lists the files and directories in the current working directory.

The tool gives a results like the `ls -l` unix tool. Each line contains two parts:
 - the file mode
 - the file name

For example in the output below, `mydirectory1` is a directory while `myfile0` is a regular file.

```
drwxr-xr-x mydirectory1
-rwxr-xr-x myfile0
```
